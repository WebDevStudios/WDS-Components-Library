# WDS-Components-Library

The WDS Components Library is a collection of WordPress-ready components that can be dropped into any WordPress project. The WDS Components Library works really great with our starter theme [wd_s](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s), but can be used with any WordPress theme.


## Features

Integration with CMB2  
Integration with ACF Pro


## Getting Started

Within each component folder, you'll find the code necessary to make each component work, along with a readme that will guide you in terms of where all the pieces belong. You can also see a practical example of how the components can be integrated by having a peek into the wd_s theme included in the project repo.
