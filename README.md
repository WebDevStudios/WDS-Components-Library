## Working Locally ##

### Prerequisites ###
The WDS Component Library is built with the [WDS Plugin Generator](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/generator-plugin-wp), so a basic knowledge of adding includes with the plugin generator is a good start.

You will also need [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) to view / add / update custom fields.

You will also need [node](https://nodejs.org/download/).

Once you have all prerequisites, run

```
npm install
```

within the `wds-components-library` directory.


### Adding Components ###
To add a new component, add a template part to the `components` directory. Components should be named `component-` + `name_of_component.php`. `name_of_component` _must_ match the name used within the ACF Components flexible content field group (including underscores). This allows the component display function to automatically grab the correct template part.

As an example, let's look at the image hero component. Within the flexible content field group, it is named `image_hero`. Therefore, it's template part must be named `component-image_hero.php`.

Please see the README.md within the `components` directory for more information.
