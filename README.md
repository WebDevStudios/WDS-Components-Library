## Working Locally ##

### Prerequisites ###
The WDS Component Library is built with the [WDS Plugin Generator](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/generator-plugin-wp), so a basic knowledge of adding includes with the plugin generator is a good start.

You will also need [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) to view / add / update custom fields.

You will also need [node](https://nodejs.org/download/).

Once you have all prerequisites, run

```
npm install
```

within the `wds-components-library` directory.


### Adding Components ###
To add a new component, run

```
yo plugin-wp:include <component-name>
```

within the plugin directory.

Assets, including styles and scripts, for each component should be contained to their own partials within `assets/css/sass/components` or `assets/scripts/components`, respectively.

To add a component to the flexible content field for the components CPT, add a case for the flexible content field group in the `display_component()` function within `class-component.php`.

Example:
``` php
public function display_component( $post_id = 0 ) {

    // Get the post id.
    if ( ! $post_id ) {
        $post_id = get_the_ID();
    }

    // Get our data.
    $component = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'component', true );

    // Determine which layout to grab.
    foreach ( (array) $component as $count => $component ) {

        switch ( $component ) {

            // Image Hero.
            case 'image_hero' :

                wds_component_library()->image_hero->image_hero_markup( $post_id, $count );
                break;

            // My new component.
            case 'my_new_component' :

                wds_component_library()->my_new_component->my_new_component_markup( $post_id, $count );
                break;
        }
    }
}
```
