# WDS Component Library Component Templates

The WDS Components Library is driven by template parts, which helps establish better separation between logic and markup. New component templates may be added here, in this folder, or within the theme (parent or child) within `template-parts/components`.


## Adding a component

Simply create a new file named `component-XXX_xxx.php`. The name of the component should match the field name used for flexible content.
